"""Single-worker FIFO queue for background job planning (preview).

The plan queue runs the same preview/estimate computation that the plot
worker would otherwise do at plot time, but eagerly — kicked off when a job
is created or edited. By the time the user clicks Plot, the estimate is
already on the job record and ``_preview_cache`` is warm so the plot's own
planning step is an instant cache hit.

Optimization comes first: a plan task that needs an optimized SVG calls
``optimize_queue.request_for_job`` (with ``on_running=None`` so the job's
status isn't side-effected — the job stays ``queued``). FIFO order means
the job's own optimize task naturally runs before its plan task.

# Statuses worth planning. A draft is included on purpose: it exists so the user

# queue is single-slot, niced below the plot worker (see app/workload.py), and
# cancelled the moment the job is edited or deleted.
#
# Everything past these two belongs to the plot worker, which is already
# planning the job itself; re-planning underneath it would just duplicate work.
